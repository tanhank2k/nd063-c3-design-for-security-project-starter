# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
    Use the open-source tool Checkov
### Example vulnerability
    Insecure Security Group Rules: Checkov can detect overly permissive security group rules in Terraform scripts, 
    such as allowing inbound traffic from the internet (0.0.0.0/0) to sensitive ports like SSH (22) or RDP (3389).
##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
    Using Amazon Inspector
### Example vulnerability
    Outdated Software Packages: Amazon Inspector can identify instances running outdated or vulnerable software 
    packages that need updates or patches.
##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
    Using Amazon Config
### Example vulnerability
    Unencrypted S3 Buckets: Amazon Config can detect S3 buckets that do not have server-side encryption enabled, 
    which is against best practices for sensitive data storage.
