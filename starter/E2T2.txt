Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Problem SECURITY HUB
1. Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port 22
2. VPC default security groups should not allow inbound or outbound traffic
3. Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 to port 3389

Problem AWS CONFIG
1. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances have a public IP association.
2. securityhub-s3-bucket-logging-enabled (This control checks if an Amazon S3 Bucket has server access logging enabled to a chosen target bucket)


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
SECURITY HUB
1. To prohibit ingress to port 22, remove the rule that allows such access for each security group associated with a VPC.
Restrict the IP range that can access port 22.
2. To remediate this issue, start by creating new least-privilege security groups. 
After assigned the new security groups to resources, remove all inbound and outbound rules from the default security groups
3. To prohibit ingress to port 3389, remove the rule that allows such access for each security group associated with a VPC.
Restrict the IP range that can access port 3389.

AWS CONFIG
1. Modify the subnet settings to ensure it does not automatically assign a public IP when instances are launched.
Ensure that new instances are launched in private subnets that do not have a route to an Internet Gateway directly.

2. Amazon S3 Bucket has server access logging enabled to a chosen target bucket.
