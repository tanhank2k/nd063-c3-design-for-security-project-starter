# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
I have followed the tutorial and waited more than 30 mins, but I can find any SSHBruteForce attacks.
# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
After researching the docs, GuardDuty analyses and processes data from CloudTrail data events for S3, CloudTrail management event, DNS logs ,
EBS Malware Protection, EKS audit logs, Lambda Network Activity Monitoring, Runtime Monitoring, VPC flow logs, etc.
